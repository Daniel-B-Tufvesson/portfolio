                        <p>
                            This was a project for a web development course at Link√∂ping University.
                            I created this together with my fellow student and friend Karin Stendahl.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            The game is a variant of the classic Breakout game, where the player controls
                            a paddle, and must bounce a ball onto bricks which will then break. The game
                            is won when every brick is broken.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In our version, the player must break all the bones. The player must also 
                            avoid any falling broken bones. And instead of a ball, there is an angry-lookin 
                            skull bouncing around.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            We knew we wanted to make a Breakout game, but we didn't have a particular theme
                            in mind at first. It was during one of our design meetings that we randomly joked
                            about "bone-breaker" being a funny name for the game. And from there, we quickly 
                            came up with the idea about the ball being a skull, the bricks being bones, and
                            it taking place in a hellish world. 
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        We added a health system to the paddle, due to the difficulty added 
                        by the falling broken bones. This was both to give the player a
                        second chance for any mistakes, as well as alleviating the problem
                        of "impossible situations", that is, situations where the skull and 
                        a falling bone fall to same place, forcing the player to either
                        lose the skull or get hit by a bone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also added a heart block, which drops a healing heart when broken.
                        The heart must then be caught with the paddle to restore one health-point.

                    <h2>MULTIPLE SKULLS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Breaking a certain skull block causes new skulls to spawn. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Periodically having multiple skulls changes the intensity in
                        gamplay, and leads to more variation in playing experience.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's very hard to keep multiple skulls in play for an extended
                        period of time, as these skulls are easily lost. However, it's 
                        only when losing the final skull, that the paddle takes damage. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>FUN CHAOS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The skull blocks can sometimes lead to a chain reaction of skulls
                        spawning. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This adds an element of chaotic unpredictability, as these chain
                        reactions can quickly lead to either loss or victory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personally, I find these moments to be the highlights when playing
                        the game, as I always look for opportunities to trigger these
                        chain reactions.

            <!-- CODE DESIGN -->
            <div class="project-section">
                <div class="section-media">
                </div>

                <div class="section-info">
                    <h2>CODE DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our two main principles regarding the code design was scalability
                        and reusability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scalability in the sense that it should be easy to add new things, 
                        such as new objects or new game mechanics. And to do this without
                        having to change much of the already existing code. This meant 
                        that we encapsulated much of the behavior of the individual game
                        objects to their respective classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And reusability in the sense that we don't want to write the same
                        code twice. For the game objects, this meant that much behavior
                        could be inherited from superclasses. For example, the skull block
                        and heart block inherits most of their behavior from the bone class.
                        This can be seen in the class diagram below depicting the inheritance
                        of all the game objects in the game.

                    <h2>SPRITE DESIGN</h2>
                    <p>
                        We envisioned the game's graphics to consist of pixelated sprites, 
                        giving the game a charming look and feel, despite the game's 
                        fairly edgy theme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sprites were created by me, and as a basis I used some sprites 
                        from some of my earlier games. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the hellish background, however, I used generative AI
                        to create. I prompted it to generate a "hellish landscape with
                        lava set in a cave". I then blurred it and altered its hue to
                        make it more suitable as a background, as to make the sprites 
                        "pop out" more, and to minimize background cluttering which would
                        only lead to unnecessary cognitive load on the player.  
                    </p>
