                        <p>
                            Unearthed is about exploration, survival, crafting, mining, 
                            and most importantly automation! The game is set in a 
                            procedurally generated 2D tile world. The player must collect resources 
                            in order to make machines that can process those resources. And from these,
                            the player can build further machines that collect even more resources. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project started in 2017 as a simple platformer game contained within 
                            a small world. Over the years, both my skills and ambitions grew, and as
                            well did the game. I have always loved games like Minecraft and Terraria, 
                            and when playing them I regularly contemplate how one would go about making 
                            such a game oneself. So it was only natural that I would try to implement
                            something similar myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game is far from finished, and the development is currently put on 
                            hold. However, the game still has a lot of playable elements, and can
                            be quite enjoyable despite being unfinished.

                    <h2>AUTOMATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        As the game progresses, more and more advanced items can be 
                        crafted, and these often require larger quantities of resources.
                        To keep up with this increasing demand, the player can automate
                        both the resource gathering and the crafting tasks. This is 
                        done by crafting certain machines and assembling them into 
                        factory production lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These machines require electricity in order to operate.
                        Electricity is generated with different kinds of electric
                        generators, for example, solar panels or windmills. These
                        generators can then be connected with cables to batteries
                        and machines.

                    <p>
                        The machines also require items and resources to craft new 
                        items. These items can be transported to and from the
                        machines using pneumatic tubes. Items can also be stored in
                        different storage containers when they are not being used.

                    <h2>AI AGENTS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game has a number of AI agents, which can either be friendly
                        or hostile to the player. The sophistication of their behaviors 
                        varies from each kind of AI. Some are very simple, while others
                        have more complex and autonomous behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The more sophisticated agents use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)&oldid=1178252094">behavior tree</a> 
                        system that I implemented.
                        Essentially, any given behavior can be broken down into a set
                        of simpler behaviors. These in turn can be broken down again.
                        Eventually the behaviors become so simple they don't have to 
                        be broken down any more. In this way you can create complex
                        and sophisticated behaviors from very simple, mindless 
                        behaviors.

                                A sentry robot patrolling a small area, scanning for players. When
                                detecting the player, it goes into attack mode and starts firing
                                lasers. (This was recorded during development, so the lasers do no
                                damage to the player.)

                        Everything from caves and ore deposits to plants and mountains
                        are generated in some way by using the two kinds of noise.

                    <p>
                        The core principle here is: scalability, scalability, scalability!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When working on a game this large, with all its diverse
                        components and functions, scalability is crucial. Adding new
                        (and removing old) game objects should be easy. The game must
                        not break, and it must not take a performance hit. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take the blocks in the map for example. Currently, the map can contain
                        exactly 1 800 000 blocks (and it can contain far more!). The
                        problem is then, how do you keep that many blocks in memory
                        without a massive performance hit? And further, how do you
                        read and write all of that to the disk when the player loads
                        and saves the game? My solution came from the realization that
                        most blocks in the map are of the same type, and don't contain
                        any unique data of their own, i.e. they are all duplicates. So,
                        instead of storing, for example, a unique dirt block at each
                        location in the map, I instead store only one single dirt block.
                        This single block is then referenced from every location where
                        there should be a dirt block, making it seem like there are 
                        several dirt blocks.
