                            This was a project for a web development course at Link√∂ping University.
                            The goal of the project was for each student to create their own creative
                            but more or less useless input field. We were supposed to create something
                            akin to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-worst-input-fields/">these</a>.
                            Volume Space Program was my contribution.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            The task here is to launch a tiny rocket into orbit around the planet. The 
                            rocket's distance from the planet determines the volume.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            When developing the idea for this, I knew I wanted to do something fun
                            involving physics and gravity. It wasn't enough for it to be hard to use, 
                            it should also be enjoyable; easy to fail, but easy to try again.
                        </p>

                    <h2>ORBITAL MECHANICS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal is essentially to achieve a stable orbit around the 
                        planet. While hard, this is possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created the orbital mechanics from greatly simplifying Newton's
                        law of gravity, essentially saying, objects closer each other 
                        attract each other more than those further away.

            <!-- SPACE DEBRIS -->
            <div class="project-section">
                <div class="section-info">
                    <h2>SPACE DEBRIS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Crashing the rocket drops debris into orbit. These follow the 
                        same orbital mechanics as the rocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After many crashes, space can become quite cluttered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a final touch I added to give more depth to the 
                        orbital mechanics. While it's not just quite mesmerizing to 
                        watch, it also gives the player a sense that their actions
                        have an impact on the game world.
